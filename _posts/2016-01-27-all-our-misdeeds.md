The Odd Type anthology will feature original works by Andrew Allanson, Rob E. Boley, Jean-Luc Bouchard. Kathleen Hale, Cassandra Khaw, Joseph J. McCallister, and Hananah Zaheer.  

The authors explore changes, choices, and consequences in ways absurd and realistic, cosmic and trivial. Stories traverse different realities and continents and feature a spectacular cast of characters: shape-shifting revolutionaries, curious children on a mission, a murderer's assistant, and a girl who brings her father back to the world of the living.
